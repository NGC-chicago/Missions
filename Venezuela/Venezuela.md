## Brief Overview

<img src="/Venezuela/images/Flag-Venezuela.jpg" alt="Venezuelian flag" style="zoom:40%;" />[^1]

[Venezuela](https://goo.gl/maps/gnyrUBQ7dcXnZqhS8) is a South American[^2] country in the northern hemisphere of the continent next to [Colombia](https://goo.gl/maps/jNcmjSCsfmgcTxQu5) & [Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/vnwT9yoGo2PcQZgj6). It declared independence form Spain on July 5, 1811.

[Venezuela](https://goo.gl/maps/gnyrUBQ7dcXnZqhS8) was a Democratic country between 1958 - 1995 until the election of [Hugo Chávez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez). Now, Venezuela is a socialist[^4] country run by [President Nicolas Maduro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro). President Maduro has known to be [authoritarian](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/authoritarian) leader.

Venezuela was once the richest and most promising country in Latin America. It has the [largest oil reserves](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-russia-oil-specialreport-idUSKBN1AR14U) in the world, and for a long time it had a growing democracy. But today, its economic and democratic institutions are failing. While inflation skyrockets, food and medicine [have become unaffordable](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/2/22/14688194/venezuela-crisis-study-food-shortage) for the country’s poor, who now make up a staggering 82 percent of the population. But instead of fixing these issues, president Nicolás Maduro has only focused on [keeping himself in power](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/7/31/16058998/venezuela-election-maduro-constitution). Despite violent protests across the country, Maduro has manipulated the system to gain control of all branches of government through a recent vote.

## The State of the Country

#### Inflation

The biggest problem facing Venezuelans in their day-to-day lives is hyperinflation.

<img src="/Venezuela/images/_105345703_venezuela-inflation_v3_976-nc.png" alt="Venezuela's Inflation" style="zoom:50%;" /> 

>  According to [BBC "Venezuela: All you need to know about the crisis in nine charts"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46999668)

According to a study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, the annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018. By the end of last year, prices were doubling every 19 days on average. This has left many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food and toiletries. The number of bolivars - the national currency - needed to buy [USD](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usd.asp) $1 has also rocketed. 

#### GDP if falling

What is [GPD?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) [^3] [Gross domestic product (GDP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given country’s economic health.

Venezuela once boasted Latin America's richest economy - boosted by the biggest oil reserves on the planet.

But under former president Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013, and current President Maduro, corruption, mismanagement and high levels of debt have seen the country's economy collapse.

> According to [BBC "Venezuela: All you need to know about the crisis in nine charts"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46999668) 

President Chávez took advantage of the oil boom in the 2000s to borrow heavily and government spending soared. Then, during President Maduro's first term in office, the Venezuelan economy went into freefall. Many blame him and his socialist government for worsening the country's decline. President Maduro blames "imperialists" - the likes of the US and Europe - for waging "economic war" against Venezuela and[ imposing sanctions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46524248) on many members of his government. Plummeting oil prices in 2016 compounded the oil-dependent country's crisis.

#### Food & Medicine Shortage

Venezuelans are going hungry. Six out of 10 said they had gone to bed hungry because they did not have the money to buy food. Most people (64.3%) said they had lost weight in 2017 - 11.4kg on average, with the poorest losing most.

Venezuela has suffered a huge rise in the number of malaria cases in recent years - in stark contrast to neighboring countries in Latin America, where numbers are falling.

## Christianity in Venezuela

#### Religion in Venezuela

Just like every other country in the world, Venezuela has more then one religion that is practiced. Most Venezuelans clamming to be Catholic

| Religion :pray:                             | Percentage % |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Roman Catholic                              | 71%          |
| Protestant Christianity                     | 17%          |
| Non-Religious w/ 6% Agnostic & 2% Atheist   | 8%           |
| Santeria                                    | 1%           |
| Other (i.e. Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, etc.) | 3%           |


The Venezuelan Constitution protects the rights regarding freedom of all religious practices as long as those practices do not interfere with public decency and order or infringe upon the religious rights of others. Despite this, the country has experienced instances of religious persecution. Anti-Semitism has been expressed on both public and private media channels. Evangelicals report obstacles to registering their religion with the government. Additionally, Mormons have been denied access to their house of worship because it has been occupied by flood victims. As of 2014, the US Department of State was unsuccessful in its attempts at holding a discussion with the government concerning issues of religious freedom.

#### The State of the Church

Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999, campaigning on the socialist promises of a [Bolivarian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_Revolution). He ushered in what has been called [twenty-first-century socialism](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/world/americas/chavez-restyles-venezuela-with-21stcentury-socialism.html), styled after Cuba and China. He consolidated power and became the autonomous dictator, leading his country into hyperinflation, ravaging the country’s natural resources, and leaving most citizens with no hope for the future.

The empire of Hugo Chavez has been described as not only corrupt but evil. Even though it’s been five years since his death, his legacy casts an even greater shadow than his life. His handpicked successor, Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s current president, has perpetuated Chavez’s renown by styling him into an immortal figure.

Maduro created a cult that glorifies the “[eternal commander](https://theconversation.com/how-todays-crisis-in-venezuela-was-created-by-hugo-chavezs-revolutionary-plan-61474),” making Chavez’s burial place a center of worship and prayer to Chavez. In some churches, the Lord’s Prayer has even been changed to say, “Our Chavez, who art in heaven.” Maduro proudly claims that he communes with Chavez, and he reportedly hosts rituals and sacrifices at the presidential palace in Chavez’s honor.

Reportedly, some churches have even removed “our Father” from the Lord’s Prayer in exchange for “Our Chavez, who art in heaven.” The [IMB](https://www.imb.org/about/)[^6] reports that government officials are participating in rampant idol worship, spiritism, witchcraft and materialism.

Monica Starr (a missionary with [IMB](https://www.imb.org/about/)) calls it “an evil, lawless society,” and Venezuelan Christians feel the situation is one of biblical proportion. “Psalm 126 is a reality for us,” said a Venezuelan church planter. “Venezuela is under captivity by an evil empire.” There is incredible materialism, actual idol worship, spiritism, and witchcraft taking place by government officials.

Many Christians forced to leave the country believe the decline of their country is God’s judgment on the spiritual depravity.

## What God is doing

Although they weep for their country as prophets wept for Israel, Venezuelan Christians also see how God is working in the crisis so people may know him. Just as Israel was refined, tested, and purified under captivity, so there are signs of the same thing happening in the Venezuelan church.

To the human eye, Venezuela’s social and economic situation seemed to plunge into a sudden free fall three years ago, but God knew what was coming and was already preparing the church. Church attendance and the number of new Christians have been steadily increasing since 2000. When New Tribes missionaries were kicked out of the Venezuelan jungles in 2005, the local church’s response was an awakening of missionary fervor.

“It was a turning point,” said Theo. “It sparked a reaction by the Venezuelan church. They said, ‘Okay, the North American missionaries have been thrown out, but they can’t throw us out!’ and they began developing discipleship programs with a DNA of missions and church planting.”

What had been a trickle of interest became a flood, and hundreds began to commit their lives to taking the gospel to the far reaches of the globe. IMB leadership was in place in Venezuelan seminaries and churches at that time to help train and develop leadership, tasks the Venezuelan church now nearly owns as it reaches people inside and outside the country’s border.

Even though Christians are among the many who are leaving the country, their numbers are replaced by new believers very quickly. “Thirty percent of a church leaves, and within six months they have the same number of people,” [Theo Starr](https://www.imb.org/about/)(a missionary with [IMB](https://www.imb.org/about/)) said. Since 2005, more than four hundred churches have been planted in Venezuela.

## What we can do
Although this crisis doesn’t regularly make headlines in America right now, the reality is that it is the largest rapid displacement of people in the Americas ever witnessed, and [as big as the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2018/03/02/feature/i-cant-go-back-venezuelans-are-fleeing-their-crisis-torn-country-en-masse/?utm_term=.a0ff24ba64e5). Sending help has proven difficult. Large humanitarian operations have been barred from entering the country because the Venezuelan government won’t allow outside aid and refuses to acknowledge that there is a crisis. The help that comes will have to be through individuals and ministries dedicated to helping quietly.

The Starrs[^7] and a team of coworkers labor in Colombia and daily organize help through contacts in Venezuelan churches. They source medicines and foods to send over the border, facilitate projects to get parcels delivered to individuals in-country, are bringing Venezuelan believers out for rest, training, and support.

The Starrs[^7] network to make needs known, figuring out the best ways to help—feeding programs, medical clinics, missions conferences, discipleship training, trauma training, and small business start-ups both inside and outside the country through local contacts.

They started the [RaVenz Project](https://www.facebook.com/The-Ravenz-Project-2046249388979655/) so people who want to help can [purchase small amounts of groceries](https://www.tupanamarket.com/) and have them delivered in-country to individual homes. Through this project, the Starrs[^7] have figured out how to purchase food and other supplies in USD so the hyperinflation doesn’t affect the buying power. With inflation predicted to top one million percent by year’s end, this has been pivotal.

The Starrs[^7] and their team have also partnered with Baptist Global Response to begin several projects, such as [feeding the hungry](https://www.gobgr.org/projects/venezuela-response/). You can also [email the Starrs directly](mailto:SOSVenezuela2540@gmail.com) to ask how you can support farming projects, Venezuelan refugees, and Venezuelan kids or seminary students.

But even more important than the practical help is the knowledge that we, the church, know about the crisis and stand alongside Venezuelans. “They have told me that even more important than the food or the money, is that we don’t forget them,” Monica said
